# DigitRecognizer_KNN_Classifier

A digit recognizer trained using the KNN model over the MNIST Dataset. The dataset contains 42000 image pixel values. Each image being of size (28x28) pixels.
So, the training dataset is of total 42000 rows and 784 columns. It's a huge dataset and gives good results as well.

I got an accuracy of 93.87%. Will improve this for sure :)
